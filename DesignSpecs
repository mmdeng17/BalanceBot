S - set of states
	t - Time
	ax - x-acceleration
	ay - y-acceleration
	az - z-acceleration
A - set of actions
y - (gamma) discount factor
R(s,a,s') - reward received by taking action a and transitioning from s to s'
T(s'|s,a) - probability of transitioning to s' from s after taking action a

At a given timestep t
receive s_t
execute a_t
transition to s_t+1 and get a reward r_t

Q(s,a)

Observe a transition s,a,r,s',a'
compute TD error: d = r+y*Q(s',a')-Q(s,a)
update Q: Q(s,a) = Q(s,a)+alpha*d
